# canlii_analytics

A project analyzing data retrieved from court cases published on CanLII.

## metadata

This is the working tool for analyzing the CanLII data and putting together a research corpus. The tool works from source code and does not download any files, but does currently allow the user to save an HTML and Markdown file to disk. This will be removed once the data model is fully developed and the program can reliably output to JSON.
